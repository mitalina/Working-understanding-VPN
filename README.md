  ## Verify the Connection

- Visit: https://whatismyipaddress.com

- Confirm your IP matches the VPN server location

- Ensure all desired apps use the VPN tunnel

## VPN Encryption

Encryption is the process of converting readable data into unreadable code to prevent unauthorized access.

VPNs use tunneling protocols to encrypt data before it leaves your device, and decrypt it once it reaches the secure server.

## VPN Privacy Features

- Kill Switch – Cuts internet if VPN disconnects to prevent leaks.

- DNS Leak Protection – Hides your DNS queries from your ISP.

- IP/WebRTC Leak Prevention – Stops your real IP from being exposed.

- Perfect Forward Secrecy – Creates new encryption keys for each session.

- Obfuscation – Hides VPN use in restrictive regions.

- Multi-Hop VPN – Routes traffic through multiple countries for extra anonymity.

- RAM-Only Servers – Wipe all data on reboot, leaving no trace.
